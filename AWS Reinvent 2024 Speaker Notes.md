Good afternoon everyone. Thanks Moshe and Karthik for that insightful conversation so far. My name is Vivek and I lead Growth at Confluent.
I am thrilled to be here today to discuss how we leveraged `Buy with AWS` for our product and share some exciting early results.

## Slide 3 & 4: Intro to Confluent (1 minute)
Before we dive into all that let me take a minute to explain what Confluent is, and why AWS Marketplace is so relevant for us.
<img width="492" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 4 11 26 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/578492ec-4084-49f7-9de5-3f7b8c93e9ca">

Confluent offers a real-time data streaming platform based on the foundations of Apache Kafka and Apache Flink, and re-engineerd to be a highly available, fully managed, cloud-native service. 
We offer this platform as Confluent Cloud, a SaaS offering, and as Confluent Platform, a self-managed offering.

With over 120 kafka connectors to databases and applications Confluent is a top choice for businesses that value real-time use cases and engineering teams that run reliable microservices.

So, its no surprise that when these teams need a data streaming platform, they adopt Confluent Cloud via AWS Marketplace. 
In addition to acting as an acquisition channel to acquire new logos, our continued partnership with AWS Marketplace in general allows us to retain and grow these logos via private offers.

## Slide 5: Challenges Faced before adopting Buy with AWS (2 minute)
<img width="495" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 4 11 43 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/accd04e5-7091-4d4d-af2a-f5e23237767b">
Despite how important AWS Marketplace is for us, if you were to go on our website and try to signup using AWS Marketplace, you would notice significant friction points. 
- New User: When a new prospect would come to our website and intend to signup via AWS, we has to direct them to the AWS listing, losing track of funnel progression and conversion data. 
In order to reduce the dropoffs, we had to have CTAs in emails and ads that sent prospects directly to the AWS. This made it challenging to measure return on efforts.

- Existing Users: For existing users of confluent cloud who wished to consolidate billing with AWS Marketplace, all we could do was offer a link to a doc that showed them how to create a subscription and add that info to their settings.
- This limited us in retaining and expanding accounts with AWS propensity.

Here is how we solved both of these challenges by adopting `Buy with AWS`

## Slide 6: Frictionless New Customer Acquisition (1minute)
<img width="495" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 4 11 53 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55532455-6215-40a3-8219-cd34229fa399">
`Buy with AWS` offered us a mechanism to direct traffic to AWS Marketplace and have a callback to Confluent. This enabled us to something unique - to position AWS logo alongside other Single Sign On options like Google and GitHub.
This, was a game changer because the procurement page offered a seamless interface that users can use to not only set up a subscription, but also get redirected back to confluent to set up their Confluent Cloud account.

## Slide 7: Optimized Partnership Page for New Customer Acquisition
<img width="492" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 4 12 05 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/900531b5-6008-401b-a7d7-34c04bb6dddc">
Another way we leveraged `Buy with AWS` for New Customer Acquisition was to add the CTAs along with `Available in AWS Marketplace` messaging on our AWS Partnership page. 
To further scale the adoption to emails and other landing pages, we have created pre-formatted sections and CTAs that the entire marketing team can re-use in their content whenever they deal with an audience that has high propensity for AWS.

## Slide 8: Seamless experience for Existing Customers
<img width="492" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 4 12 17 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ff935e9-1be5-4040-b161-5e93ee8588ce">
For existing customers of Confluent Cloud who prefer to streamline their procurement and billing via AWS Marketplace, users can now go to their billing settings, click on the AWS as a payment method, and successfully link their billing with AWS Markeplace in all of 2-3 clicks.
We are seeing almost 2x conversions from this implementation and this is extremely valuable for us because we see a 20% higher consumption from AWS linked accounts.

## Slide 9: Summary & Key Points
